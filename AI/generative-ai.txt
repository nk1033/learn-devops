 Prompt engineering:
 *******************
 easiest way to use LLM'S
 Prompts - text instructions or input queries to given the genAI model to get resent information.
 Prompt Engineering : crafting and optimizing prompts for best results.


 
 RAG's - Retrieval Augmented generation
 *************************************

 it helps to retrive information from external sources, leveraging LLM's 

 AI Agents :
 ***********
 AI agents can make decisions and execute actions and adapt to new situations based on the data and instructions they receive.
