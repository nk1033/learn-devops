-- > add labels to the resource to find which team is consuming more cost.

1) optimize your compute resource 
  - right sizing
  - enable autoscaling
  - leverage premittible / spot instances
2) Manage storage and Data transfer
   - choose correct storage class based on your usage.
        * standard -- for frequet access
        * coldline / nearline -- for in-frequent less than 1 month or quarter 
        * archive - for more than one year 
   -  implement lifecycle policies, to delete old files or transfer storage class
   - Minimize data eggress, data transfer within regions or from gcp to internet will cost more.

3) Implement financial governance 
   - Set budgets and alerts
4) Architecture and CICD integration.
   - use tools like terraform / argocd to revert manaual changes.
   - integrate kubenrets / docker as a jenkins agents 
   - use server less services like cloud app engine / cloud run / cloud functions
