Relational Databases (SQL)
Relational databases are the traditional and most widely used type of database. They are based on the relational model, which organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") consisting of columns and rows.

Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
Non-relational databases, also known as "NoSQL" (Not Only SQL) databases, are a more modern and flexible alternative. They were developed to handle the massive volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data generated by web and mobile applications.

PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS). This means it is a type of database that uses the relational model, organizing data into tables with columns and rows, and using a predefined schema. It is a prime example of a "structured" database, which is designed to handle structured data and uses SQL as its primary language.
