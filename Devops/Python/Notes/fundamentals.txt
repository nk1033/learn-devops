comparision operators:
**********************
10 > 3
10 == 3
10 >= 3
10 != 3

"big" > "BIG"
print(ord(b))


identity operators -- boolion operators 

a is b   -- print true or false 

a is not b --- print true or false 

logical operation == AND OR NOT 

relational operators 

== != >= <= > < 



conditional statements: if elif else 
***********************
## for loops  -- if we want to run multiple times fixed number
while -- when we not sure about the number of execution and it depends on the condition based on user input.

loops --it is a repetative execution of block of code.

for number in range(3):
  print("Attempt")

for i in range(10):
    print("Naresh")

loops are 2 types 

1) for loop   ---- syntax ---- for i in sequence ( range, list, tupple )
2) while loop --- 

loop manipulation :---

break
continue 

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

for i in numbers:
   if i == 3 :
   break
   print(i)


for i in numbers:
   if i == 3 :
   continue
   print(i)



How to create a functions:
**************************
function we can create use def keywork along with function name and paranthasis 

def greet():

there are 2 types of functions.

1) perform a task 
2) return a value 

print / return - print will just disply the output and return will use to send the message to a file or send email then will use return.


Variables:
*********
we have 2 types of variables, - 1. global variables 2.local variables 

if you are defining the variable within the function then it is local scope variables, if you are defining the variable outside the function then it is Global scope variables.

functions & moddules & packages
********************************

import calculator_new as basic_calc

basci_calc.addition()

if we have a code in calculator_new.py with addition() , sub() , multiplication() functions. you can use that as a moddule and re-use to other programe using import.

module is used for re-useablity , it is a collection of functions.

Use import , to pull module in our code 
use from , to pull a specific function from a module to our code. 


functions, take inputs perform the tasks and return the output.

packages is nothing but collection of modules .

we have pre-defined modules 

aws -- boto3
github --- github
jira --- jira 

http --- requests .

PYPI -- python package index --- this is the place where our packages / modules are hosted.

to install these packages use pip 

pip install boto3 
pip install requests .

virtiual environment 
********************

it will do a logical seperation on your virtual machines for the python packages.
it is required if you want different python versions for multiple projects.

pip install virtualenv.  - to install

python -m venv project-abc  - to create

source project-abc/bin/activiate  - to activiate 

deactiviate -- to deactiviate


Environment Variables & command line arguments 
***********************************************

sys.argv[1]
sys.argv[2]

python basic-cal.py 2 3 

by default arguments read as strings 
we need to convert them as integers.

num1 = int(sys.argv[1])
operation = sys.argv[2]



if operation == "add":
   output = add(num1 , num2) 
   print(output)


environment variables : to add sensitive data 

export passoword ="Naresh"
import os 

print(os.getenv("Password))


dictionaries:
**************
it will store data as key value pairs, it is like a properties .

my_data = [{
  "name" = "Naresh",
  "age" = "20",
  "city" = "hyderabad"
}]


we can print a specific value by using index and key 

print(my_data[age])

if we have multiple dictionaries

print(my_data[1][city])



GIthub-jira integration
***********************
create a jira account and create API token - 

ATATT3xFfGF0IdyCOPo2ac4hr4gmEj2A4s6AlZibHFxKpwJ3sSpsWx8wnzOHMhLEdTOy-pyPaIRry9J5WHrTMz4PNzFD2cvKW0CCmFkttHUJ03p023nQaNNNwEeivaS_aLTvP6c573U5Zzlw9tHWSwCJOHSWz230znL3-FYueWGZP1VjW0qCUnw=ADCD0D09

will use flask framework for the python application API 

in API - will use 4 request types 

POST - to add a entry 
GET - to fetch details of a entry
PUT -  to modify an entry 
DEL -  to delete an entry
