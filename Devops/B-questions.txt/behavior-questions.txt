When Waterfall is a better choice:
Projects with clear and stable requirements: If the project's requirements are well-defined, unlikely to change, and can be documented in detail from the beginning, Waterfall's structured approach can be highly effective

When Agile is a better choice:
Projects with evolving requirements: If the project's requirements are likely to change or are not fully known at the outset,
