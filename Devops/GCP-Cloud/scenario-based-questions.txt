scenario: my application is deployed on private subnet , how can i access that application from internet ?
************************************************************************************************************

A)  - Use public facing load balancer in public subnets and route request to the private subnet where the application deploed.
    - Use NAT gatewy , allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound connections , NAT gateway alone canot be used a direct access to the application.

scenario1: my application deploed on vpc1 and i need to access this application from vpc 2?
*******************************************************************************************

if application deployed on shared vpc then by default all projects from service project are able to connect.
if two different vpc's then we need to raise request for VPC peering.

How It Works
Create a peering connection request from VPC 1 to VPC 2.

The owner of VPC 2 must accept the request.

Update the route tables in both VPCs. You must add a route in each VPC's route table that points to the other VPC's CIDR block, with the peering connection as the target.

Ensure that security groups and Network ACLs (NACLs) are configured to allow traffic between the peered VPCs.

or use Transit gateway.

How It Works
Create a Transit Gateway.(aws) / HUB & Spoke models ( GCP ) which is called as NCC - network connectivity center  /  use cloud router ( dynamically exchange routes between your VPC and on-premises network)

Attach VPC 1 and VPC 2 to the Transit Gateway.

Configure the Transit Gateway's route table to allow traffic to be routed between the attached VPCs.

Update the route tables of each VPC to route traffic destined for other VPCs to the Transit Gateway.
