1) How to to enable CDN for kubernets.
A) create deployment and service for the application as nodeport / loadbalancer ( ingress will manage the external exposure)
   create backend config for CDN
   create ingress and associate backendconfig in the annotations .

2) explain the steps of traffic flow routed to an application when we hit a url in the browser in kubernetes?

Browser (Client)
      |
      | (DNS Resolution)
      V
DNS Server (myapp.example.com -> Load Balancer IP)
      |
      | (HTTPS/HTTP)
      V
Cloud Provider's External Load Balancer (e.g., ALB, GCP HTTP(S) LB, App Gateway)
      |   (SSL Termination, WAF, DDoS Protection)
      |
      V
Kubernetes Node (via NodePort)
      |   (kube-proxy routes to Ingress Controller)
      V
Ingress Controller Pod (inside Kubernetes)
      |   (Inspects Ingress Resource rules: hostname, path)
      |   (Routes to Service Cluster IP)
      V
Kubernetes Service (Cluster IP)
      |   (kube-proxy load balances across Pods)
      V
Application Pod (e.g., my-web-app-xxxxx)
      |
      V
Application Container (e.g., NGINX)
      |
      | (Response)
      V
